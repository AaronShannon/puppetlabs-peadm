# Puppet Enterprise (pe) Administration (adm) Module

This Puppet module contains Bolt plans used to deploy and manage Puppet Enterprise infrastructure. Plans are provided to automate common lifecycle activities, in order to increase velocity and reduce the possibility of human error incurred by manually performing these activities.

The peadm module is able to deploy and manage Puppet Enterprise 2019.x Standard, Large, and Extra Large architectures.

## Expectations

The peadm module is intended to be used only by Puppet Enterprise customers actively working with and being guided by Puppet Customer Success teamsâ€”specifically, the Support team and the Solutions Architecture team. Independent use is not recommended for production environments.
